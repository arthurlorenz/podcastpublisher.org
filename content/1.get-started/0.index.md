## 1. Installation

To begin using **Podcast Publisher**, install and enable the module:

Download and install the module:
```bash
composer require drupal/podcast_publisher
drush en podcast_publisher
```
## 2. Accessing the Podcast Feed

Once you've created a podcast, the module automatically generates an XML feed for it. The feed conforms to standard podcast feed formats, making it compatible with platforms like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and others.

### How to Access the Feed

The feed URL follows this format: `/podcast/{podcast_id}/feed.xml`

- Replace `{podcast_id}` with the ID of the podcast you want to access.
- Example: If your podcast's ID is `123`, the feed URL will be `/podcast/123/feed.xml`.

### Key Features of the Feed
- **Automatic Updates**: The feed reflects all published episodes of the podcast.
- **Compatibility**: The feed is formatted according to RSS standards, ensuring compatibility with popular podcast directories.
- **Custom Fields**: Metadata such as titles, descriptions, and images are included automatically.
